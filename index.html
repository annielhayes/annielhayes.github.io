<p>Hello! My name is Annie Hayes. I am a sixteen year old junior in high school at <a href=”http://www.bobjonesacademy.net/”>Bob Jones Academy</a>.<br>
My weekdays consist of drinking Starbucks Iced Chai Lattes, doing yoga on stressful afternoons, and<br>
running cross country at BJA. <br> <br>
On Fridays and Saturdays, I usually am hanging out with my best friend Maria, editing pictures to post <br>
on my <a href=”http://vsco.co/annielhayes/”>VSCO</a>, or watching Netflix when I should be studying.<br> <br>
Sundays, I go to my home church, <a href=”http://www.fbctaylors.org/”>Faith Baptist in Taylors</a>! Apples would have to be my favorite food.<br>
I am always reading and planning what adventure I should go on next, and at the end of September I’m<br>
going up to Washington D.C. <br> <br>
My favorite season would have to be Autumn: the colors, big pumpkins, knit sweaters, corn mazes… <br>
what's not to love!? I am currently gluten-free because I loved bread way too much. I hate coffee, <br>
and I don’t enjoy chocolate. My favorite passage of Scripture is Psalm 126! <br><br>
<i>Psalm 126 <br>
 <b> A song for pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem. </b> <br><br>
<b>1.</b> When the Lord brought back his exiles <br>
to Jerusalem, it was like a dream! <br> <br>
<b>2.</b> We were filled with laughter,<br>
 and we sang for joy.<br> <br>
 And the other nations said,<br>
 “What amazing things<br> 
 the Lord has done for them.” <br><br>
<b>3.</b> Yes, the Lord has done <br>
amazing things for us! <br>
What joy!<br><br>
 <b>4.</b> Restore our fortunes, Lord,<br>
 as streams renew the desert. <br><br>
 <b>5.</b> Those who plant in tears <br>
 will harvest with shouts of joy. <br><br>
<b>6.</b> They weep as they go to plant their seed, <br>
but they sing as they return with the harvest. </i> </p>
